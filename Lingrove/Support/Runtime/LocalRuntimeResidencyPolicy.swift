///
/// Why this exists as its own type: the answer depends on the completion switch, engine, and two
/// Apple Intelligence fallback switches, and two different places act on it. `AppDelegate` starts
/// or stops the runtime when any of them changes, and the fallback model picker in Settings decides
/// whether choosing a model should load it now or only record it. One pure rule keeps those callers
/// from drifting apart and lets tests pin the table without AppKit or a real model.
///
/// "Not resident" does not forbid loading. Under Apple Intelligence the language fallback still
/// loads the selected model on demand (`LlamaRuntimeManager.preparedRuntime()`); this policy only
/// answers whether Lingrove should load it ahead of time and keep it there. Disabling completion
/// also closes runtime admission, so even on-demand fallback stays unloaded until it is enabled.
